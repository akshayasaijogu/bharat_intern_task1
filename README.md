--Movie Recommendation ML Project
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation ML Project! This project is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history using machine learning techniques. The project includes a Streamlit app for user interaction and visualization.

--Overview
The Movie Recommendation ML Project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze user interactions with movies and generate personalized recommendations. By leveraging user preferences and viewing history, the system aims to suggest relevant and engaging movie choices to users.

--Features
Personalized Recommendations: The system offers personalized movie recommendations tailored to each user's preferences and viewing history.

Machine Learning Techniques: Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to generate recommendations.

Streamlit App: The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit app for easy interaction and visualization of recommended movies.

--Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data processing, machine learning modeling, and interface development.

scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating recommendation models.

Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation libraries used for data preprocessing and analysis.

Streamlit: Web application framework used for building the user interface.

--Getting Started
To get started with the Movie Recommendation ML Project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
